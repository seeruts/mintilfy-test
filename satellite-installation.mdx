title: Install the Resolve Satellite for Kubernetes
description: 'Deploy the satellite and enable DNS Tap'

## Deploy satellite

### Ingest Token Creation

The satellite communicates with the Resolve SaaS backend over an authenticated and encrypted channel. The authentication is done via an API token that should be created by an administrator from the UI. Below are the steps to create a token.
- Login to https://app0.resolve.ai
- In the sidebar, select “Ingest Tokens”
- Click “Create Ingest Token”
- Give a name to remember your token, click “Create ingest token”
- Copy your token and save it somewhere for the next step. Click “I copied the token!”

### Helm Based Deployment
The satellite should be deployed using our helm chart. The chart is extensible and allows several configuration options to customize.

In order to deploy the chart, run the following command:
```
helm install resolve-satellite oci://registry-1.docker.io/clouddatalabs/satellite  --set ingest.token="<token-generated-above>" --set clusterName="<name of cluster>" --environment="environment"
```

## Enable DNS Tap

### What is DNS Tap? 
DNS Tap is an open source logging / monitoring technology that enables DNS servers to
efficiently forward DNS logs to a TCP socket. The logs contain all DNS queries and
responses made by the DNS server, as well as the requester’s IP and port. This DNS
information can be used to determine which source IPs are requesting IPs for which other
Servers. 
More information can be found at https://dnstap.info/. A good talk on performance implications of DNS Tap and its implementation specifics can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ3vUUi_FG8).

Enabling DNS Tap takes two steps.

1. Enable DNS Tap on your satellite by including the following configuration setting on
your Resolve Satellite. 

````
dnstap:
  enabled: true
````
<Tip>If you do not want to capture information about external services, set ```ignoreExternalIPs:true```</Tip>

2.  Update your coredns configuration to forward DNS Tap logs to the resolve satellite.
(a) To do this, first get the cluster IP of the Resolve satellite in kubernetes

```kubectl get service <your satellite name>```

(b) Update the coredns configmap to forward logs by adding the following config to the main (or “data”) config block

```dnstap tcp://<your satellite IP>:4444 full```

<Accordian title="AKS / Azure">
Enabling DNS Tap involes adding a new file called coredns-custom.yaml. 

1. Enable DNS Tap on your satellite by including the following configuration setting on
your Resolve Satellite. 
````
dnstap:
  enabled: true
````
<Tip>If you do not want to capture information about external services, set `ignoreExternalIPs:true`</Tip>

2. Create a `coredns-custom` config in the `kube-system` namespace.
```corednsms.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: coredns-custom
data:
  dnstap.override: |
    dnstap tcp://<satellite-svc-clusterip>:4444 full
```

<Accordian title="GCP">
Unfortunately, DNS Tap is not currently supported on out-of-the-box GKE. If you want to
enable DNS Tap on GKE, you first need to switch the GKE cluster to use coredns instead
of kube-dns.
